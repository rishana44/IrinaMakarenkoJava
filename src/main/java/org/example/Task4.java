public class Task4 {
// Answer the questions
// Given bracket sequence: [((())()(())]]
// Can this sequence be considered correct?
// If the answer to the previous question is “no”, then what needs to be changed in it to make it correct?
}
//Answer:
//No. Because according to one of the basic principles of encapsulation, code that refers to a method, class, loop,
// or condition must be between parentheses. Parentheses round, square, curly, charcoal all of them must open and close. The code will work within these brackets.The correct parenthesis sequence is: [[((())()(()))]]
// P.S. Excluding access modifiers
